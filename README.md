# lZ77Encoder

## Overview
lZ77Encoder is a Go implementation of the LZ77 encoding algorithm, designed for efficient string compression. This tool encodes input strings using a sliding window technique, optimizing data representation and reducing redundancy.

## Features
- Customizable dictionary and buffer sizes
- Efficient string encoding using the LZ77 algorithm
- User-friendly command-line interface

## Installation
To use lZ77Encoder, you need to have Go installed on your system. Follow these steps to install and run the encoder:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MrInsome/lZ77Encoder.git

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   cd lZ77Encoder

3. Compile the Go program:
   go build

## Usage
Run the compiled binary and follow the on-screen instructions. You will be prompted to input the dictionary size, buffer size, and the message you wish to encode.
Enter the required details as prompted, and the encoded output will be displayed.
